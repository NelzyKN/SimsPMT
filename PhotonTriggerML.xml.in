<!-- Configuration of PhotonTriggerML Module (balanced training + bounded dynamic threshold)
     Notes:
       • PhotonThreshold is a BASE operating point. The code applies a small dynamic
         adjustment per trace using distance and TOT-like width (risetime+falltime),
         then clamps the effective threshold to [0.60, 0.82] to avoid “all-photon” / “all-hadron”
         pathologies seen in earlier logs (see your summaries for 0.80 and 0.72 runs).
       • We keep this file minimal; additional tags are documented but optional. -->

  <!-- Energy range for trigger application -->

  <!-- Base neural-network threshold for photon classification.
       Recommended start: 0.65 (dynamic clamp still applies). -->
